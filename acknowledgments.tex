\section*{Personal Acknowledgments}

It is not possible to arrive at this stage -- finishing a PhD project -- without the help and influence
of a considerable amount of people and chances are high that I will have forgotten to mention some of them.
This section will present my gratitude towards all the countless people who have been important to me
on my way to where I am now in a perceived chronological order.

Firstly I have to thank my fellow undergraduate students, especially \emph{Peter Freiwang}, \emph{Daniel Reiser} and
\emph{Alexis Kassiteridis} for treading the path with me and for showing me what is important
-- albeit by giving a negative example for a certain fellow student. Another person who must be
mentioned is Prof. Dr \emph{Harald Lesch} who not only awoke my interest in physics
when I was young but also turned out to be an inspiring professor, not only of Astrophysics but
especially in Philosphy.

Special thanks for arousing my interest in accelerator physics go to Prof. \emph{Lenny Rivkin} and
\emph{Adrian Oeftiger}.

I want to thank my colleagues and friends here at CERN for the memorable time, both in the office and
in our free time: \emph{Marco D'Andrea}, \emph{Sondre Vik Furuseth},
\emph{Alexander Krainer}, \emph{Elena Fol} and \emph{Joschua Dilly}.
Some deserve a special mention:\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
\emph{Jaime Coello de Portugal} (and I skip the rest of his name) for an enthusiastic introduction
to programming, computer games and for pulling me into some fun hobby projects like soldering my own
keyboard.\\
%\item
\emph{Michael Hofer} for being at the same time an invaluably helpfull and incredibly annoying
office mate, for his view of the bigger picture, his bad jokes and the tea and cookie times.\\
And to \emph{Marian Lückhof} for the many many dicussions and for preferring early lunch.
%\end{itemize}

And last but not least I want to express my deep gratitude to my family: My parents, \emph{Martin}
and \emph{Sigrid} who raised me to become the person I am now, for believing in me and supporting me.
And of course to \emph{Lorène} for being in my life.
