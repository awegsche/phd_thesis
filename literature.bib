@article{Bartolini1997,
abstract = {Normal Form is a powerful tool to analyse the nonlinear content of a complicated system like an accelerator with its many thousands of high order multipolar errors. This technique needs as input a mapping from the initial to the ?nal coordinates. Unfortunately, a map of an accelerator is not known beforehand but has to be determined for a complete lattice of the accelerator including all calculated and/or measured error tables of the guiding and focussing magnet elements. It is however possible to obtain turn{\{}by{\{}turn position data of a kicked beam for many turns. In various experiments at existing accelerators it has been shown that these data are equivalent to tracking data produced by simulation programs. In this report we will demonstrate how tracking data can be used to determine, with excellent precision, the coe?cients of the generating function. The well tested Normal Form tools can then be used to construct the underlying Hamiltonian and the map. The essential tool is the recently developed frequency analysis which allows for a very precise determination of the tunes using beam or tracking data.}}},

abstract = {In this article we present the measurement and correction of the chromatic coupling in the LHC. The transverse coupling is calculated from turn-by-turn data, exciting the beam with an ac dipole. By adjusting the momentum relative to the reference energy and repeating the measurement, we obtain the transverse coupling dependency on momentum. The measurements are compared to the predictions from the magnetic model, and show good agreement. We describe the algorithm used to calculate the corrections, which are performed using skew sextupoles in the LHC lattice. A reduction in the chromatic coupling of a factor 2.5±0.4 for beam 1 and 1.6 ±0.3 for beam 2 was obtained after applying the corrections. Published by the American Physical Society.},

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI. Since 2015 the LHC has been operating at 6.5 TeV. In 2016 the $\beta$-functions at the interaction points of ATLAS and CMS were squeezed to 0.4 m. This is below the design $\beta$∗=0.55 m at 7 TeV, and has been instrumental to surpass the design luminosity of 1034 cm-2 s-1. Achieving a lower than nominal $\beta$∗ has been possible thanks to the extraordinary performance of the LHC, in which the control of the optics has played a fundamental role. Even though the $\beta$-beating for the virgin machine was above 100{\%}, corrections reduced the rms $\beta$-beating below 1{\%} at the two main experiments and below 2{\%} rms around the ring. This guarantees a safe operation as well as providing equal amount of luminosity for the two experiments. In this article we describe the recent improvements to the measurement, correction algorithms and technical equipment which allowed this unprecedented control of the optics for a high-energy hadron collider.},

abstract = {In this article we present the measurement and correction of the chromatic coupling in the LHC. The transverse coupling is calculated from turn-by-turn data, exciting the beam with an ac dipole. By adjusting the momentum relative to the reference energy and repeating the measurement, we obtain the transverse coupling dependency on momentum. The measurements are compared to the predictions from the magnetic model, and show good agreement. We describe the algorithm used to calculate the corrections, which are performed using skew sextupoles in the LHC lattice. A reduction in the chromatic coupling of a factor 2.5±0.4 for beam 1 and 1.6 ±0.3 for beam 2 was obtained after applying the corrections. Published by the American Physical Society.},

The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ, H→γγ and H→WW(⁎)→eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ZZ(⁎), WW(⁎), bb¯ and τ+τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ and H→γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4(stat)±0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7×10−9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson."

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one."
